# Introduction
YOLO v2, also known as YOLO9000, is an advanced object detection model that builds upon the strengths of its predecessor, YOLO v1, while addressing its limitations. Introduced by Joseph Redmon and Ali Farhadi, YOLO v2 offers significant improvements in both speed and accuracy, making it a powerful tool for detecting objects in images and videos.

# Key advancements in YOLO v2 include:

1-Batch Normalization: Applied to all convolutional layers, this technique improves model performance and reduces the need for other regularization methods.
2-High-Resolution Classifier: The model is initially trained on 224x224 images and then fine-tuned on 448x448 images, enhancing its ability to detect objects at higher resolutions.
3-Anchor Boxes: These are used to predict bounding boxes, improving the model’s ability to generalize across different object sizes and shapes.
4-Darknet-19 Backbone: A more efficient and powerful feature extractor compared to the original YOLO architecture.
5-YOLO v2’s ability to process images at 45 frames per second (FPS) with high accuracy makes it ideal for real-time applications, such as autonomous driving, surveillance, and robotics.

# Key Features
Real-Time Detection: Capable of processing images and videos at high speeds.
Improved Accuracy: Enhanced detection accuracy with fewer background errors.
Better Generalization: Effective across a wide range of object sizes and shapes.
